    * This method is called when the attribute <code>bodyWrtStructural</code> is updated.

    * <br>Description of the data type from the FOM: This is a quaternion quantifying the orientation of a 'subject' reference frame with respect to some other 'referent' frame. Quaternions consist of one scalar component and a 3-element vector component and can be denoted Q = (s, V), where s is a scalar and V is a vector (x, y, z). Confusion often arises regarding the meaning of the quaternion. (There are several similar but incompatible conventions.) This data type defines a so-called 'left unit transformation quaternion'. It may be used to transform the elements of a vector V_R = (xR, yR, zR) resolved in the referent frame's coordinate axes into the corresponding elements of a vector V_S = (xS, yS, zS) resolved in the subject frame's coordinate axes (i.e. determine the components of the same vector in another coordinate system). The quaternion transformation formula is (0, V_A) = Q . (0, V_B) . Q*, where '.' denotes quaternion multiplication and * denotes quaternion conjugation. The formula for multiplication of the quaternion Q1 = (s1, V1) where V1 is the vector (x1, y1, z1) by the quaternion Q2 = (s2, V2) where V2 is the vector (x2, y2, z2) is Q3 = Q1 . Q2 = (s3, V3) where s3 = s1 s2 - (x1 x2 + y1 y2 + z1 z2) and V3 = (x3, y3, z3) with x3 = s1 x2 + s2 x1 + (y1 z2 - z1 y2), y3 = s1 y2 + s2 y1 + (z1 x2 - x1 z2) and z3 = s1 z2 + s2 z1 + (x1 y2 - y1 x2). The formula for conjugation of the quaternion Q = (s, V), where V is the vector (x, y, z) is Q* = (s, -V) = (s, (-x, -y, -z)).
