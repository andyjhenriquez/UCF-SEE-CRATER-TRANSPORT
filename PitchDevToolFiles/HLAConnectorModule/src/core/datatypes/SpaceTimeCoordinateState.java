/**
 * Implementation of the <code>SpaceTimeCoordinateState</code> data type from the FOM.
 * <br>Description from the FOM: A multi-dimensional representation of an observational coordinate frame and associated state.  There are three spatial dimensions, three attitude dimensions and one time dimension.  The spatial and attitude components define a right-handed orthogonal set of coordinate axes that constitute a reference frame.  The time dimension specifies the 'position' of the coordinate with respect to the physical time scale (TT).
 * <p>
 * This class is <code>Immutable</code> (and therefore <code>ThreadSafe</code>)
